# Sticky webclient

The browser client reads chain RPCs directly. Its Python service serves an explicit
set of public assets with Waitress and WhiteNoise; it does not hold wallet keys or
relay transactions. Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt`.

## Run locally

```sh
cd webclient
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
STICKY_DEMO=true python build-config.py
python serve.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8788`. Demo mode is explicit and read-only. For real chain data,
set deployment variables from `.env.example`, then run `python build-config.py`.
The generator writes next to itself regardless of the working directory. It does
not automatically load `.env`; source an appropriately filled file or set the
variables through the hosting platform. Restart the server after changing files.
Existing local `config.js` files are ignored by Git and are changed only when the
generator is explicitly run. Fixtures in a hand-written config (`demoHome*`,
`demoChartHistory`, `*Overrides`) show only in demo mode or in a `localMode: true`
config on localhost; a live page drops them.

## Production configuration

Use `/webclient` as the Railway service root and `/webclient/railway.json` as its
configuration file (the path starts at the repository root, independent of the
service root). Railway installs
`requirements.txt`, generates public configuration, and starts `python3 serve.py`.
HTTPS is provided by the platform. `PORT` binds the service to all interfaces; the
local default binds only to loopback. `/healthz` is the readiness endpoint and
includes the Railway Git revision when available. A service without a valid
configuration or any referenced script refuses to start in production.

`STICKY_DEMO` defaults to false. Contract addresses and each chain's scan start
block come from `deployments.json`, which `build-config.py --sync-deployments`
generates from the repository's verified deployment records (`deployments/<network>/`).
The `deploy:post:*` scripts regenerate it, and CI fails when it drifts from the
records, so a redeploy needs no Railway variable changes. The address variables
below still override it, for a local chain or a staged redeploy. A live build
requires a deployer for `STICKY_DEFAULT_CHAIN` (default: Ethereum mainnet). Global
fields in the generated config are resolved from the selected default network.
All eight mainnet/Sepolia RPC entries are emitted; configuring an RPC alone does
not mean Sticky contracts are deployed there. Runtime transaction checks validate
the destination chain and deployed contracts.

`STICKY_FROM_BLOCK_<chainId>` overrides a chain's recorded scan start block. Provide
reliable RPCs that support historical logs. Explicit `STICKY_RPC_<chainId>` values
override the shared Dwellir key. Every value in `config.js`, including RPC URL keys,
is public: use keys intended for browser access and restrict them to your domain.
The service never publishes `.env`, Python source, examples, tests, or directory
listings. Configuration is not cached; scripts and HTML must revalidate.

Contract deployments are a separate prerequisite; `deployments.json` lists only
chains with verified deployment records. A successful health check verifies the
site's build and configuration, not on-chain contract deployment or RPC uptime.

`StickyRewardReceiver` holds arriving ERC-20 rewards for one Sticky token and
reward group until they are settled into the distributor. `StickyRewardReceiverFactory`
predicts and deploys those receivers, so each project and group has its own
destination address even before its receiver is deployed. Its address comes from
`deployments.json` (override: `STICKY_REWARD_RECEIVER_FACTORY_<chainId>` or the global
`STICKY_REWARD_RECEIVER_FACTORY`); generated and hand-written configurations use
`rewardReceiverFactory`. The client derives the individual receiver address with
`predictReceiverOf(address,uint256)` and settles arrivals through the factory's
`settleFor(address,uint256,address)`, where the `uint256` is the reward group
chosen in the funding dialog's stake-age fields.

## Sign in

The connect button opens one chooser: Sign in with Signa (a passkey account; Signa
frames its sign-in inside the dialog) or connect a browser wallet. It uses Homerun's
flow from `@bananapus/nana-sdk-connect/core`, vendored as `center-connect.js` and
served from this origin. `vendor/build.sh` rebuilds it from the pinned
`vendor/package-lock.json`, and `vendor/build.sh --check` fails when the committed file
differs. Signa sends the sign-in back to `/center/callback`, the only page that can be
framed, and only by this site.

Set `STICKY_CENTER_WALLET_ENABLED=true` with the manifest pins (see `.env.example`)
only after Signa admits the site's origin and `/center/callback`. A Signa account is
an address for reads: positions, rewards and the account page. Every transaction asks
for a browser wallet ("This action needs an external wallet."), because Signa's review
covers only Base USDC payments and Sticky's stick pays the project's own token.

## Creating a Sticky token

Pick the token by address or by Juicebox project ID. A plain ID (`5`) resolves to that
project's ERC-20 on every selected chain and must name the same token on each; a
chain-prefixed ID (`base:5`) resolves once on that chain. Either way the token must
have the same address, name, symbol and decimals everywhere the launch goes.

Options: a custom name and symbol (defaults "Sticky <token name>" and STICKY<SYMBOL>),
a stickiness bonus of 0, 5, 10 or 25% or a custom 0 to 99.99%, trusted senders,
transfers Unlocked (default) or Locked, and the chains. AutoStick is a trusted sender
on every launch, so a chain without a configured AutoStick helper can't be selected.

Each chain hands out its own next project ID, and the Sticky token address includes it,
so IDs and token addresses differ across chains. The project URI carries a `launchId`
shared by every chain of one launch, and the launch steps link each chain's project.

### Juicebox Center listing

Each launch is listed on Juicebox Center as a signed project intent (format
`sticky.center/deploy.v1`). After you confirm the deployment review, your wallet
signs Center's message for the exact calls (`personal_sign`; wallet addresses only,
so a Safe or other contract account launches unlisted), and the launch is then sent
as before: directly for one chain, or through one Relayr bundle for several. Each
chain's deployment is recorded on Center (`POST /v1/intents/:id/deployments`) once it
has 2 confirmations.

Center refusing or being unreachable never blocks a launch. The launch says "Not
listed on Juicebox Center" and offers a retry. The listing ID and what was recorded
live in the saved launch, so a reload resumes without publishing or recording twice.

Center sponsors a launch only through the V6 ERC-2771 forwarder. When every selected
chain is one Center sponsors and `StickyDeployer.isTrustedForwarder(forwarder)` is
true on each, the site publishes the listing and asks Center to deploy it; you send
no transaction. Today's StickyDeployer does not trust the forwarder, so launches are
self-paid. Set `STICKY_CENTER_URL` to another HTTPS origin to use a different Center.

## Transactions and recovery

Multichain creation requests a Relayr prepaid quote for the frozen deployment
configuration. Funding choices appear only after the quote has been matched to
every destination transaction. Choose a quoted chain, review its exact ETH amount,
and make one payment. A single-chain creation uses the same reviewed transaction
runner as other wallet actions.

Sticking, unsticking, grants, unlocked-token transfers, rewards, trusted senders,
and auto-stick use the connected wallet on the project's chain. Approvals and
dependent actions execute in sequence. The displayed account preview and demo
cannot submit transactions. Native ETH rewards are supported for direct funding;
bridging uses supported project ERC-20 tokens and their verified V6 sucker pair.
Cross-chain funding has separate reviewed prepare, transport, claim and settlement
steps because the bridge must deliver its message before rewards can be claimed.

Keep the browser's saved transaction and launch records until completion. Refresh
or resume to recheck canonical receipts. An unresolved wallet submission is never
sent again automatically; use its execution hash to recover it. Safe proposals
remain pending until their exact execution is verified. A finalized outer Safe
failure alone does not invalidate a proposal.

Safe recovery binds the execution to the wallet's returned proposal hash, returned
execution hash, or an exact replacement at the same executor nonce. An identical
inner call from another proposal is insufficient. If a Safe wallet returned no
reference, preserve its record: the client cannot identify the original proposal
from an execution hash alone. Ordinary wallet submissions can recover a verified
finalized revert, after which the saved plan can be reviewed again or dismissed.

Sticky's deployed factory has no deployment nonce or idempotency key. A published
launch quote therefore cannot be discarded or replaced merely because it expired,
the API timed out, or one chain reported a failure. Keep the original record and
recover destination execution hashes; republishing could create duplicate projects.
The recovery UI exposes only clearing that is supported by the saved evidence.

New stakes use the terminal's `previewPayFor` result as their exact minimum token
output. Issuance follows current backing; Sticky balances and tranches are share
amounts with 18 decimals, distinct from underlying token amounts. The immutable
project feed supplies the exact backing denominator; the client does not derive
issuance from an independently rounded exchange rate. Zero issuance or excessive
share rounding fails before staking. The account page
loads at most 50 tranches at once, so incoming dust cannot force an unbounded read.
Claimable backing excludes funds left when no shares existed. The current home-page
value uses that claimable backing; its historical chart estimates past share counts
at today's backing per share and token price, rather than reconstructing past prices.

Unstick quotes come from the terminal's views at one block: `previewCashOutFrom`
for the gross reclaim and tax, then the terminal's own fee rule (`FEELESS_ADDRESSES`,
positive tax charges the whole reclaim, zero tax only the `feeFreeSurplusOf` part,
floored at 1/40). The dialog quote is the minimum the review sends; an `eth_call`
preflight only checks for a revert.

Every write is checked before the wallet sees it. `calldata.js` decodes each step
against a fixed registry of the functions the site sends, with strict canonical ABI
decoding, and the review shows only decoded values. An unknown function, a hidden
argument, or a value that differs from what the review names blocks Confirm.

The holder list comes from the hook's own events (each `Staked` and `Unstaked`
carries the resulting balance), one scan per project view starting at the project's
creation block; the visible page is re-read from the hook. A multichain launch writes
one `launchId` into every chain's `projectUri`; the project page finds each
same-environment chain's project and shows backing and supply per chain with totals.
Log scans follow a node's stated range limit, including HTTP 413 answers.

Rewards show the current round and when it ends, and per group the amount claimable
now, vesting with its next and last unlock dates, earned in finished rounds but not
vesting yet, and funding. Collecting starts a 4-round unlock, a quarter per round.

Bendystraw lists each environment's Sticky projects (owned by the deployer) and their
pays and cash outs, so the home page reads no chain history: its cards, Latest,
Airdrops and chart come from Bendystraw, and each card's backing and supply from chain
views. Launches past Bendystraw's indexed block are found by a short `DeploySticky`
scan. A project's creation block comes from Bendystraw's creating transaction, checked
against its receipt. Bendystraw does not index StickyHook positions, tranches or
streaks, so project pages still scan the hook, from that block. Any Bendystraw error
falls back to chain scans.

The page reaches Bendystraw only through `serve.py`, locally as in production, the way
juicebox.money and revnet.money do: it posts `{"operation": "<sha256 of the document>",
"variables": {...}}` to `/api/bendystraw/<mainnet|testnet>/query` and gets back
`{"data": ...}` or `{"error": "..."}`. The relay forwards only the documents in
`bendystraw-operations.json` (`{sha256: document}`), with variables that fit their
declared types, and answers anything else with a 400. Identical requests share one
answer for 15 seconds. After adding or editing a query in `runtime.js`, regenerate the
registry and commit it:

```sh
python3 bendystraw-registry.py          # rewrite bendystraw-operations.json
python3 bendystraw-registry.py --check  # CI: fails when the registry is stale
```

The 100% cash out tax permanently makes unsticking return zero underlying tokens.
The auto-stick adapter quotes issuance during execution and rejects zero-token
mints, including high-decimal reward dust. Its UI estimate can change before
confirmation. Auto-stick is best effort: anyone can collect rewards to the holder's
wallet before a keeper executes; those rewards remain available for manual staking.

## Checks

Run from the repository root with the Python environment activated:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s webclient/test -p 'test_*.py' -v
for script in webclient/*.js; do node --check "$script"; done
node --test webclient/test/*.test.cjs
webclient/vendor/build.sh --check
```

The separate `webclient` GitHub workflow runs these gates, builds the explicit demo,
builds a live config for all 8 chains and checks each has a deployer and starting
block, then starts the real production HTTP entry point with that live config. Contract tests remain
under `forge test`; they do not broadcast transactions.
